## Overall Strategy

Two types of positions I'm looking for 

**SWE position**: 
- Facebook: algorithmic questions, 
- Google: SRE: algorithmic questions

**DeepMind**
- review all ML knowledge, 
- Build fancy projects (NPI)
- familiarity with DeepMind research

#### How do I get there?
- do well with algorithm questions
- solid knowledge base in ML
- build badass projects and resarch
- focused literature research in key areas of interest

#### The TODOs
**every single day**
- [ ] Leet code
- [ ] Andrew Ng course review
- [ ] paper reading
- [ ] research project
- [ ] blog posts


## TODOs
- [ ] Write blog post on Boltzmann machine [5hr]
- [ ] Actor Critic vs GAN [5hr]
- [ ] Asynchronous Advantagous Actor-Critic Learning 
- [ ] What is Boltzman Machine
- [ ] How is Boltzman Machine used in Hintton's Paper?
- [ ] start reviewing Andrwe Ng's class
- [ ] start to go through Google Brain research papers on ICLR

## Missions
- List of machine learning questions [link](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/09/40-interview-questions-asked-at-startups-in-machine-learning-data-science/)
- **important** apply to Google Brain Residency 
    => [application](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/packets/8379525c-38c3-4a15-9c64-d5af4ce45e88/form)
