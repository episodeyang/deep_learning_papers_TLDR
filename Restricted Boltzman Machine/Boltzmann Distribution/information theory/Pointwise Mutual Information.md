Pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a measure of association. [Mutual information] is built on top of PMI. Mutual information is an ensemble measure, while PMI is a pointwise measure for individual events.

\begin{align}
\mathrm{pmi}(x;y) & \equiv \ln \frac{p_{x,y}}{p_x p_y} \\\
&= \ln \frac{p_{x|y}}{p_x} = \ln \frac{p_{y|x}}{p_y}
\end{align}
