# Deep Learning Papers TLDR

My collection of notes on deep learning papers.

To take a look at some of my projects and notes on deep learning that's not directly related to literature research, go [here: @episodeyang/deep_learning_notes](https://github.com/episodeyang/deep_learning_notes#notes-on-deep-learning)

## Reading List (TODO)

I will keep this todo list short. This is what I'm working on this week.

### ICLR 2017 Best Papers

- [work in progress] "Making Neural Programming Architectures Generalize via Recursion"

- "Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data"

### ICLR 2017 Best Papers

- [**Notes on** "Understanding deep learning requires rethinking generalization"](ICLR%202017Understanding%20deep%20learning%20requires%20rethinking%20generalization.md)
    
    Google Brain, Through experimentation, authors shows how traditional 
    approaches to generalization failes to explain why large neural networks 
    generalize well in practice. They also explains why deep learning requires 
    rethinking generalization.

## Sources

The source of this repo is mostly:
- various online reading lists
- Conferences
- Courses: this is probably the most important source because they are structured
- friends and colleague's recommendations

## Other Repos

My lab-mate [Nelson](https://github.com/nelsonleung)'s notes can be seen [here](https://github.com/nelsonleung/deep-learning-papers-reading-notes).
