1. run sentence embedding over regular language or language with 
    context-free grammar. 

    compare embedding of different sentences, 
    find differences between sentences
    learn conditional model over a parse tree
    
    
2. 

For OpenAI:
- reference extraction from PDF and text via reinforcement learning
    
    get references (and highlight) by searching through an external database
